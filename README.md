# Java Keywords, Expressions, and Methods Practice

This project contains practice code exploring fundamental Java concepts, focusing on keywords, expressions, statements, code blocks, and methods. It was developed as part of a Java programming course.

## Project Overview

The code demonstrates:

*   **Basic Syntax:** Understanding Java keywords and how expressions are formed.
*   **Conditional Logic:** Using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to control program flow based on conditions (`Main.java`, `Execrise.java`).
*   **Methods:** Defining and calling methods, passing arguments, and returning values (`Challenge.java`, `Execrise.java`).

## Files

*   `src/Main.java`: Demonstrates basic `if-else if-else` control flow.
*   `src/Challenge.java`: Introduces a method (`calculateScore`) to compute a final score based on game parameters.
*   `src/Execrise.java`: Contains methods (`displayHighScorePosition`, `calculateHighScorePosition`) to determine and display a player's rank based on their score.

## Running the Code

1.  **Compile:** Navigate to the `src` directory in your terminal and compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java Challenge.java Execrise.java
    ```
2.  **Run:** Execute the desired class file (e.g., `Execrise`):
    ```bash
    java Execrise
    ```
    *(Replace `Execrise` with `Main` or `Challenge` to run those examples)*

## Learning Focus

This project served as an exercise to solidify understanding of:

*   The structure of a Java program.
*   Declaring variables and using operators.
*   Implementing decision-making logic.
*   Creating reusable code blocks with methods.

Feel free to explore the code to see these concepts in action.
